# Autochef

Autochef is a web application that will help you decide what you can cook.

Take ingredients available from your pantry and find suggestions of recipes to create based on the ingredients on-hand. Click [Get Started] on the home page to try us out! It will simplify your cooking experience.

# Description
This application takes food on hand (your pantry) and adds it to a search to find recipes based on what's in your pantry. Select ingredients adding them to your pantry either from using the preselected category feature (sidebar) or enter in your ingredients manually using the text field (input). Select ingredients to search for recipes. Browse the queried results and if you’re missing ingredients, you can use Google Maps to find the nearest grocery store.


# Motivation
Utilizing ingredients: If you are willing to cook, and don’t know what to make for a meal, this site can help you. Using what you have is the primary goal for this applications.

Reducing food waste. It’s tough to come up with delicious meals of things you have on hand. Once you inventory what you already own to the virtual pantry, let the algorithms help utilize your items. No more produce going bad in the fridge.

Stress free. We get hungry and would like to cook but don't know what to cook. Let the search engine find what recipes you can make with what you have on hand. No more anxiety over what to make.
